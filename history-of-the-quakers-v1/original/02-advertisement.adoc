Our ancient friend William Penn (for whose writings I have a high esteem)
having given us a concise recital of the various religious dispensations,
and of various professions of Christianity,
preceding that to which the contemptuous denomination of Quakers was affixed,
in his introduction to the Rise and Progress of that People,
I thought at first I could not choose a more suitable
introduction to the ensuing history than that,
enlarged with explanatory and historical notes: But on further consideration,
the mode I have adopted seemed more eligible.
I have kept his said introduction in my eye: but have preferred a paraphrase,
before a literal transcript with notes, as exhibiting one continued narration,
without the frequent breaks, which the other method must necessarily occasion.
